# Converting docker container to a Singularity container

It is assumed that singularity is already installed, if not check the following link https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/admin-guide/installation.html.

The following command can be used on Linux systems or HPC servers such as Pawsey servers Magnus and Nimbus.
To run the jupyter notebook you will need to convert the Docker image to a Singularity image through the following command:

```
sudo singularity build favor_singularityContainer.sif docker://gwongastro/favor:version2
```

The conversion requires a bit of space, depends of the size of the image, if you need to specify a temporary directory to use for build run the following:

```
sudo singularity build --tmpdir /extension/tmp/ favor_singularity.sif docker://gwongastro/favor:version2
```

where /extension/tmp/ is the location temporary location the container.

## Running singularity and interact with a local directory

```
sudo singularity run -B $PWD:/opt/notebooks â€”writable dir_favor
```
